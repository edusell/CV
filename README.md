## Project Analysis

**User Persona:** Persona 
- **Age:** 28 years

### Information Architecture The web page is organized into several sections to facilitate navigation and highlight key information: 
1. **Home:** CV cover page with quick access to projects and social networks visually. 
2. **Studies:** A timeline representing the different studies completed. 
3. **Projects:** Section where various public projects are displayed with a brief description of their use and the technologies used. 
4. **Skills:** A list of different programming languages and sector knowledge. 
5. **Footer:** A small section to remind users of my social networks, with access to different parts of the CV. 

### Visual Design 

For this project, I decided to create a visually appealing and simple web page with various animations as you navigate to make the user experience more pleasant. I chose light colors as the base and two main colors to define a consistent style throughout the page (#4165D5 and #F1AC20). I also used the TailwindCSS framework to maintain a uniform style across the page. The design is primarily intended for desktop computers, but it is also optimized for some mobile devices.
